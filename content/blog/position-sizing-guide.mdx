# Position Sizing: The Key to Risk Management

**Position sizing** is arguably the most important aspect of trading that retail traders consistently get wrong. It's not about picking winners – it's about managing risk so that you can survive the inevitable losers and compound your winners over time.

## What Is Position Sizing?

Position sizing determines **how much money** you allocate to each trade. It's the bridge between having a trading strategy and actually implementing it with real money.

Poor position sizing can turn a winning strategy into a losing one, while proper position sizing can make even mediocre strategies profitable over time.

## The Fatal Mistake Most Traders Make

**Trading the same dollar amount on every trade.**

This might seem logical, but it's actually one of the worst approaches to position sizing because:

- It doesn't account for **varying risk levels** between trades
- It ignores **volatility differences** between securities
- It fails to **optimize return potential**
- It can lead to **catastrophic losses** on high-risk trades

## Professional Position Sizing Methods

### 1. Fixed Percentage Risk Model

Risk the same **percentage** of your account on each trade, not the same dollar amount.

**Formula**: `Position Size = (Account Value × Risk Percentage) / Trade Risk`

**Example**:
- Account Value: $100,000
- Risk per trade: 2%
- Trade risk (entry to stop-loss): $5 per share
- Position Size: ($100,000 × 0.02) / $5 = 400 shares

**Pros**: Simple to calculate, automatically scales with account size
**Cons**: Doesn't account for volatility or confidence levels

### 2. Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing

Adjust position size based on the **volatility** of the security you're trading.

**Formula**: `Position Size = (Account Value × Risk Percentage) / (ATR × Multiplier)`

Where ATR is Average True Range (a measure of volatility).

**Example**:
- Account Value: $100,000  
- Risk per trade: 2%
- Stock ATR: $3.50 (14-day average)
- Multiplier: 2 (your stop-loss distance)
- Position Size: ($100,000 × 0.02) / ($3.50 × 2) = 286 shares

**Pros**: Accounts for volatility, more consistent risk across different securities
**Cons**: More complex, requires volatility calculations

### 3. Kelly Criterion

Uses your strategy's **win rate** and **average win/loss ratio** to determine optimal position size.

**Formula**: `f = (bp - q) / b`

Where:
- f = fraction of capital to wager
- b = ratio of win amount to loss amount  
- p = probability of winning
- q = probability of losing (1 - p)

**Example**:
- Win rate: 60% (p = 0.6)
- Average win: $300
- Average loss: $150  
- b = 300/150 = 2
- f = (2 × 0.6 - 0.4) / 2 = 0.4 = 40%

**Pros**: Mathematically optimal for maximizing long-term growth
**Cons**: Requires accurate statistics, can suggest very large positions

## Position Sizing Rules to Live By

### Rule 1: Never Risk More Than 2% Per Trade

This is the **golden rule** of position sizing. Even if you have a string of 10 consecutive losses (which happens), you'll only lose 20% of your account, not blow up completely.

### Rule 2: Scale Position Size with Confidence

Not all trades are created equal. Consider varying your position size based on:
- **Setup quality**: Higher conviction = larger position
- **Market conditions**: Trending markets may warrant larger positions
- **Recent performance**: Scale down after losses, up after wins

### Rule 3: Account for Correlation

Don't take full positions in highly correlated trades. If you're long Apple, don't also take a full position in tech ETFs.

### Rule 4: Leave Room for Pyramiding

If your strategy involves adding to winners, size your initial position accordingly so you have room to add without exceeding your total risk limits.

## Common Position Sizing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Revenge Trading

After a loss, many traders take a larger position to "get even quickly." This is a fast path to account destruction.

### Mistake 2: Over-Concentration

Putting too much capital in a single trade or sector. Diversification isn't just about having multiple positions – it's about proper allocation across them.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Volatility

Taking the same position size in a volatile penny stock as you would in a stable blue-chip stock is a recipe for disaster.

### Mistake 4: Not Adjusting for Account Growth

As your account grows, your position sizes should grow proportionally. Many traders get stuck using the same dollar amounts they started with.

## Implementing Position Sizing in Practice

### Step 1: Determine Your Risk Tolerance

Most professional traders risk 1-2% per trade. Conservative traders might risk 0.5%, while aggressive traders might go up to 3-4%. **Never exceed 5%.**

### Step 2: Calculate Trade Risk

Before entering any trade, know:
- Your entry price
- Your stop-loss level  
- Your risk per share (entry - stop)

### Step 3: Apply Your Formula

Use one of the position sizing methods above to calculate your exact share quantity.

### Step 4: Adjust for Market Conditions

Consider reducing position sizes during:
- High volatility periods
- Uncertain market conditions
- After a string of losses
- When trading unfamiliar markets
