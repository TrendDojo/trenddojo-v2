**Created**: 2024-09-11 06:00
**Completed**: 2024-09-11 07:30
**Duration**: 1.5 hours

### Goal
Implement professional trading hierarchy: Portfolio > Strategy > Position > Execution to replace the flat Account > Trade structure.

### Tasks
- [x] Design comprehensive trading model schema
- [x] Reset database (test data only)
- [x] Apply migration for new structure
- [x] Create seed data with realistic trading scenarios
- [x] Build API routes for all models
- [x] Create StrategyDashboard UI component

### Outcome
**Success** - Complete refactor implemented with:
- Clean Portfolio > Strategy > Position > Execution hierarchy
- Detailed fee tracking at execution level
- Automatic P&L calculations
- Strategy performance metrics
- Full CRUD APIs
- Working UI dashboard

### Key Decisions
1. Renamed Account → Portfolio for clarity
2. Renamed Trade → TradePlan (for journaling)
3. Added Position as aggregate holding concept
4. Added Execution for individual fills with comprehensive fee breakdown
5. Strategy manages allocation and risk limits

### Files Changed
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete restructure
- `prisma/seed-new.ts` - New seed data
- `src/app/api/strategies/route.ts` - Strategy CRUD
- `src/app/api/positions/route.ts` - Position management
- `src/app/api/executions/route.ts` - Execution tracking
- `src/components/strategies/StrategyDashboard.tsx` - UI component

### Notes
- User mentioned all data was test data, allowing clean reset
- No breaking changes to handle since app had no real users
- New structure supports institutional-grade portfolio management
- Fees properly tracked at execution level where they actually occur

### Next Steps
- Integrate with broker APIs for automatic execution import
- Add real-time P&L calculations with market data
- Build position sizing calculator based on strategy rules
- Create performance analytics dashboard
