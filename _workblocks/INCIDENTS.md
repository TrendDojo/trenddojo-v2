## Incident History

### INC-2025-01-29: Screener Pagination Showing Wrong Total Count
**Severity**: Medium
**Detection Time**: 23:30
**Resolution Time**: 00:30
**User Impact**: Users seeing only 300 stocks instead of 11,446 available

#### What Happened
The screener "All US Stocks" tab was showing only 300 total stocks when there were actually 11,446 available. The pagination count was incorrect, misleading users about available data.

#### Root Cause
The API was returning the paginated data count instead of the total count. The code was calculating `total` after slicing for pagination, not before.

#### Fix Applied
- Branch: main (should have been hotfix/2025-01-29-screener-pagination)
- Commit: Multiple (should have been single commit)
- Files Changed: `/src/app/api/market-data/screener-clean/route.ts`
- Changes: Stored `totalCount` before pagination slice, returned actual total not paginated count

#### Prevention
- Always calculate totals before applying pagination
- Add unit tests for pagination endpoints
- Review other endpoints for similar issues

#### Lessons Learned
- Should have followed emergency hotfix procedure for isolated fix
- Mixed other changes (temp file cleanup) with the fix
- Need better separation of concerns in deployments
