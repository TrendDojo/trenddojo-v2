## WB-2025-01-19-001: Trading Strategy Implementation - MVP
**State**: completed
**Timeframe**: NOW
**Created**: 2025-01-19 14:00
**Updated**: 2025-01-19 15:00 (Simplified to MVP scope)
**Completed**: 2025-01-19 16:30
**Duration**: 2.5 hours
**Outcome**: Success - MVP UI fully implemented
**Dependencies**: None (simplified)
**Tags**: #trading #strategies #mvp #business-critical

### Goal
Ship a dead-simple strategy management page where users can create strategies by picking 3 rules (entry, position, exit) and track basic performance.

### What Was Built
1. **Three-Tab Interface**
   - Strategies Tab: List view with Name, Status, P&L, Win Rate
   - Entry Rules Tab: Visual cards for entry rules
   - Exit Rules Tab: Position and exit rules display

2. **Strategy Creation**
   - Modal with 3 dropdowns (Entry, Position, Exit)
   - Auto-generated names from rule combination
   - No editing after creation
   - Pause/resume functionality

3. **Fixed Rules (9 Total)**
   - Entry: Breakout, Pullback, Manual
   - Position: 2% Risk (only one for now)
   - Exit: 2R Target, Trail 20MA, Manual

4. **UI Components Created**
   - StrategiesTab with expandable rows
   - EntriesTab with visual rule cards
   - ExitsTab with position/exit rules
   - NewStrategyModal with dropdowns

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Review and align with MVP requirements
- [x] Build strategies page with tabs
- [x] Create strategy list table component
- [x] Build rules display with visual cards
- [x] Create "New Strategy" modal (3 dropdowns + create)
- [x] Implement pause/resume functionality
- [x] Add mock P&L and win rate display
- [x] Add expandable row to show positions

### Still Needed (Future Work)
- [ ] Create database migrations
- [ ] Connect to real data
- [ ] Implement actual trade tracking

### Notes
- Successfully simplified from complex original design to shippable MVP
- UI complete with mock data, ready for backend integration
- Identified stop loss gap - shown as "Coming Soon"
- Rule combinations naturally create swing vs trend strategies

## WB-2025-09-02-002: Production Deployment Pipeline Setup
**State**: completed
**Timeframe**: NOW
**Created**: 2025-09-02 13:45
**Completed**: 2025-09-08 13:20
**Duration**: 6 days (multiple sessions)
**Outcome**: Success - Full CI/CD pipeline operational
**Dependencies**: None
**Tags**: #infrastructure #deployment #github #vercel #supabase

### Goal
Establish complete GitHub → Vercel → Supabase deployment pipeline with staging and production environments.

### Tasks
- [x] GitHub repository setup with branch protection
- [x] Vercel project configuration (staging + production)
- [ ] Supabase project setup (staging + production databases) - DEFERRED
- [x] Environment variable management (Vercel secrets)
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [x] Staging deployment automation
- [x] Production promotion workflow
- [ ] Database migration strategy - DEFERRED

### Success Criteria
- [x] Feature branches deploy to Vercel preview URLs
- [x] Main branch automatically deploys to staging
- [x] Production requires manual promotion
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Database migrations work in both environments - DEFERRED

### Implementation Summary
**What We Built:**
1. **Complete CI/CD Pipeline** (.github/workflows/ci.yml):
   - 5-phase deployment: Test → E2E → Security → Staging → Production
   - Quality gates: TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest (54 tests), npm audit
   - Node.js 20 compatibility for ESM modules

2. **Automated Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Pre-deployment script (scripts/pre-deploy.sh) with 7 validation steps
   - 54 unit tests passing (financial calculations + trading safety)
   - Security audit with moderate-level vulnerability checking

3. **Vercel Integration**:
   - GitHub secrets properly configured (VERCEL_TOKEN, PROJECT_ID, ORG_ID, TEAM_ID)
   - Automatic staging deployment on main branch pushes
   - Manual production promotion with approval gates
   - Preview deployments for feature branches

4. **Deployment URLs**:
   - Staging: https://trenddojo-v2.vercel.app (configured)
   - Production: https://trenddojo.com (configured)
   - Preview: Dynamic URLs per branch

**Key Learnings:**
- Vercel token permissions were critical - needed fresh token with proper team access
- ESM compatibility required Node.js 20+ in GitHub Actions
- GitHub commenting integration needs additional permissions but doesn't block deployment

### Notes
- Supabase integration deferred until database features needed
- Database migration strategy will be addressed in next work block
- Pipeline successfully tested with real deployment
- Documentation created: docs/deployment/VERCEL_SECRETS_DEBUG.md
