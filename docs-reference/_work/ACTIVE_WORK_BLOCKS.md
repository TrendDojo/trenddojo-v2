## WB-2025-09-02-001: Critical Pattern Documentation Development
**State**: confirmed
**Timeframe**: NOW
**Created**: 2025-09-02 13:45
**Dependencies**: None
**Tags**: #foundation #documentation #production-ready

### Goal
Create essential pattern documentation to support production-ready development with proper financial validation and testing standards.

### Tasks
- [ ] **TRADING-PATTERNS.md**: Position sizing algorithms, risk/reward calculations, stop loss management, correlation rules
- [ ] **BROKER-INTEGRATION-PATTERNS.md**: API abstraction layer, mock development patterns, error handling, rate limiting
- [ ] **FINANCIAL-CALCULATIONS.md**: P&L formulas, position sizing math, risk calculations, validation requirements
- [ ] **RISK-MANAGEMENT-PATTERNS.md**: Position limits, stop loss logic, drawdown protection, account safeguards  
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE-PATTERNS.md**: Next.js structure, tRPC setup, database patterns, state management
- [ ] **SECURITY-PATTERNS.md**: API key management, financial data protection, audit trails
- [ ] **DEPLOYMENT-PATTERNS.md**: GitHub workflow, Vercel staging/prod, environment management
- [ ] **TESTING-PATTERNS.md**: Financial calculation testing, broker integration mocks, E2E workflows

### Success Criteria
- Each pattern doc contains real implementation examples
- Financial calculation patterns include unit test examples
- Broker integration patterns show complete mock setup
- All patterns reference production deployment requirements
- Documentation supports immediate development start

### Notes
- These docs are the foundation for production-ready development
- Each doc should be created when the pattern is first needed
- Focus on practical examples over theoretical explanations
- Must include testing requirements for each pattern

## WB-2025-09-02-002: Production Deployment Pipeline Setup
**State**: confirmed  
**Timeframe**: NOW
**Created**: 2025-09-02 13:45
**Dependencies**: None
**Tags**: #infrastructure #deployment #github #vercel #supabase

### Goal
Establish complete GitHub → Vercel → Supabase deployment pipeline with staging and production environments.

### Tasks
- [ ] GitHub repository setup with branch protection
- [ ] Vercel project configuration (staging + production)
- [ ] Supabase project setup (staging + production databases)
- [ ] Environment variable management (Vercel secrets)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- [ ] Staging deployment automation
- [ ] Production promotion workflow
- [ ] Database migration strategy

### Success Criteria
- Feature branches deploy to Vercel preview URLs
- Main branch automatically deploys to staging
- Production requires manual promotion
- Environment variables properly configured
- Database migrations work in both environments

### Notes
- Follow Controlla's successful deployment pattern
- Ensure staging mirrors production exactly
- Set up proper monitoring and error tracking
- Document deployment procedures for team
