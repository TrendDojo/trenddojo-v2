# TrendDojo Active Work Blocks

## ðŸ”´ MANDATORY AI CONTEXT REFRESH
**BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK BLOCK, YOU MUST READ:**
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Rules & behavior
2. `/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Project specifics
3. `/docs/_work/ACTIVE_WORK_BLOCKS.md` - Current work (this file)

**AT EACH TOUCHPOINT (session start, context switch, new task), RE-READ ALL THREE FILES**

## ðŸŒ¿ Git Branching Strategy for Work Blocks

### Approach: Inline on Main
- **Default**: Work directly on `main` branch for most work blocks
- **Rationale**: Faster iteration, less overhead for single-developer project
- **When to branch**: Only for experimental features or breaking changes
- **Commit frequently**: Small, atomic commits with clear messages
- **Work block references**: Include WB-ID in commit messages

### When to Create Feature Branches
1. **Experimental features** that might be reverted
2. **Breaking changes** that need gradual migration
3. **Parallel work** by multiple developers
4. **Large refactors** that span multiple days

## WB-2025-01-21-001: Living Theme System Implementation
**State**: confirmed
**Timeframe**: NEXT
**Created**: 2025-01-21 09:00
**Updated**: 2025-01-22 14:30
**Dependencies**: None
**Tags**: #ui #design-system #infrastructure #group-wide

### Goal
Implement a truly living theme system where the theme page and application components are tightly coupled, sharing the exact same style definitions. This will be expanded into a robust group-wide monitoring system to ensure all projects maintain this standard.

### Scope
1. **TrendDojo Implementation**
   - Complete adoption of centralized styling system across ALL components
   - Theme page must import actual components, not recreate them
   - Nuclear test must pass (delete theme page = app works, restore = perfect match)
   - Theme page organized with tabs:
     - **"Core Design System"**: Universal elements used across all projects (buttons, forms, alerts, tables, typography, colors)
     - **"Domain Components"**: Project-specific elements (trading indicators, position bars, strategy panels, broker cards, P&L displays)

2. **Development vs Production Modes**
   - **Development Mode**: Theme page visible at `/theme` for active development
     - Shows all components and variations
     - Includes experimental/beta components
     - Has interactive controls for testing states
     - Shows design tokens and CSS variables
   - **Production Mode**: Theme page hidden or requires auth
     - Prevents external access to design system
     - Only accessible to authenticated developers
     - Lightweight version without dev tools
     - Can be completely removed from production bundle

3. **Group-Wide System**
   - Create monitoring scripts to verify theme/app coupling
   - Automated checks for style duplication
   - CI/CD integration to prevent regression
   - Documentation of the pattern for other projects

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Weekly automated reports on style consistency
   - Alert system for divergence between theme and app
   - Metrics dashboard for tracking adoption

### Tasks
- [x] Document the living theme pattern in proven-solutions (COMPLETED 2025-01-22)
- [x] Create group-wide implementation guide in _shared-framework
- [ ] Audit all TrendDojo components for inline styles
- [ ] Create buttonStyles.ts, panelStyles.ts, formStyles.ts
- [ ] Refactor ALL tables to use tableStyles.ts (partially done)
- [ ] Add tab navigation to theme page (Core Design System | Domain Components)
- [ ] Organize Core Design System tab with universal elements
- [ ] Create Domain Components tab for trading-specific UI
- [ ] Update theme page to import real components
- [ ] Move universal components to Core tab
- [ ] Move trading components to Domain tab
- [ ] Implement nuclear test verification
- [ ] Add environment-based theme page access control
- [ ] Create development mode with interactive controls
- [ ] Build production mode with auth gate
- [ ] Add build-time flag to exclude theme page from production bundle
- [ ] Create style consistency monitoring script
- [ ] Create CI/CD checks for style consistency
- [ ] Build group-wide adoption tracking system

### Success Criteria
- Zero inline Tailwind classes in components (all use centralized styles)
- Theme page uses actual components from the app
- Theme page has clear separation between core and domain-specific components
- Core Design System tab is portable to other projects
- Domain Components tab showcases TrendDojo-specific patterns
- Changing one style variable updates everywhere
- Theme page is protected in production (auth-gated or removed)
- Development mode provides full design system access
- Production mode prevents design system exposure
- Monitoring system catches any divergence
- Other projects can adopt the pattern easily

### Notes
- Emerged from WB-2025-01-21 color system work where we discovered systematic issues
- Addresses the "almost the same" trap that creates UI inconsistency
- Will prevent future AI claims of "fixed" when visual changes aren't verifiable
- Group-wide impact: all projects will benefit from this infrastructure
- Tab structure enables clear separation of concerns:
  - Core tab can be copied to any project (Controlla, Three, etc.)
  - Domain tab demonstrates project-specific patterns (trading UI)
  - Makes it easier to maintain consistency while allowing specialization

- [ ] Add manual position storage in database with audit trail
- [ ] Implement accurate P&L calculations including fees
- [ ] Add bulk import capability (CSV/JSON) for trade history
- [ ] Create reconciliation workflow for manual vs broker positions

### Success Criteria
- Users can track ANY position regardless of where it was executed
- Every position can be linked to a strategy for performance tracking
- Manual entry supports full trade lifecycle (entry, scaling, exit)
- Fees and commissions properly tracked and included in P&L
- Clear distinction between manual, API, and external positions
- Can import historical trades from CSV exports
- Position journal/notes for tracking reasoning
