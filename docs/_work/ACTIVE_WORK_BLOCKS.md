# TrendDojo Active Work Blocks

## ðŸ”´ MANDATORY AI CONTEXT REFRESH
**BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK BLOCK, YOU MUST READ:**
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Rules & behavior
2. `/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Project specifics
3. `/docs/_work/ACTIVE_WORK_BLOCKS.md` - Current work (this file)

**AT EACH TOUCHPOINT (session start, context switch, new task), RE-READ ALL THREE FILES**

## ðŸŒ¿ Git Branching Strategy for Work Blocks

### Approach: Inline on Main
- **Default**: Work directly on `main` branch for most work blocks
- **Rationale**: Faster iteration, less overhead for single-developer project
- **When to branch**: Only for experimental features or breaking changes
- **Commit frequently**: Small, atomic commits with clear messages
- **Work block references**: Include WB-ID in commit messages

### When to Create Feature Branches
1. **Experimental features** that might be reverted
2. **Breaking changes** that need gradual migration
3. **Parallel work** by multiple developers
4. **Large refactors** that span multiple days

## WB-2025-01-21-001: Living Theme System Implementation
**State**: considering
**Timeframe**: NOW
**Created**: 2025-01-21 09:00
**Dependencies**: None
**Tags**: #ui #design-system #infrastructure #group-wide

### Goal
Implement a truly living theme system where the theme page and application components are tightly coupled, sharing the exact same style definitions. This will be expanded into a robust group-wide monitoring system to ensure all projects maintain this standard.

### Scope
1. **TrendDojo Implementation**
   - Complete adoption of centralized styling system across ALL components
   - Theme page must import actual components, not recreate them
   - Nuclear test must pass (delete theme page = app works, restore = perfect match)
   - Theme page organized with tabs:
     - **"Core Design System"**: Universal elements used across all projects (buttons, forms, alerts, tables, typography, colors)
     - **"Domain Components"**: Project-specific elements (trading indicators, position bars, strategy panels, broker cards, P&L displays)

2. **Development vs Production Modes**
   - **Development Mode**: Theme page visible at `/theme` for active development
     - Shows all components and variations
     - Includes experimental/beta components
     - Has interactive controls for testing states
     - Shows design tokens and CSS variables
   - **Production Mode**: Theme page hidden or requires auth
     - Prevents external access to design system
     - Only accessible to authenticated developers
     - Lightweight version without dev tools
     - Can be completely removed from production bundle

3. **Group-Wide System**
   - Create monitoring scripts to verify theme/app coupling
   - Automated checks for style duplication
   - CI/CD integration to prevent regression
   - Documentation of the pattern for other projects

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Weekly automated reports on style consistency
   - Alert system for divergence between theme and app
   - Metrics dashboard for tracking adoption

### Tasks
- [ ] Add tab navigation to theme page (Core Design System | Domain Components)
- [ ] Organize Core Design System tab with universal elements
- [ ] Create Domain Components tab for trading-specific UI
- [ ] Audit all components for inline styles
- [ ] Create buttonStyles.ts, panelStyles.ts, formStyles.ts
- [ ] Refactor ALL tables to use tableStyles.ts
- [ ] Update theme page to import real components
- [ ] Move universal components to Core tab
- [ ] Move trading components to Domain tab
- [ ] Implement nuclear test verification
- [ ] Add environment-based theme page access control
- [ ] Create development mode with interactive controls
- [ ] Build production mode with auth gate
- [ ] Add build-time flag to exclude theme page from production bundle
- [ ] Create style consistency monitoring script
- [ ] Document the living theme pattern in proven-solutions
- [ ] Create CI/CD checks for style consistency
- [ ] Build group-wide adoption tracking system
- [ ] Create template for other projects to adopt

### Success Criteria
- Zero inline Tailwind classes in components (all use centralized styles)
- Theme page uses actual components from the app
- Theme page has clear separation between core and domain-specific components
- Core Design System tab is portable to other projects
- Domain Components tab showcases TrendDojo-specific patterns
- Changing one style variable updates everywhere
- Theme page is protected in production (auth-gated or removed)
- Development mode provides full design system access
- Production mode prevents design system exposure
- Monitoring system catches any divergence
- Other projects can adopt the pattern easily

### Notes
- Emerged from WB-2025-01-21 color system work where we discovered systematic issues
- Addresses the "almost the same" trap that creates UI inconsistency
- Will prevent future AI claims of "fixed" when visual changes aren't verifiable
- Group-wide impact: all projects will benefit from this infrastructure
- Tab structure enables clear separation of concerns:
  - Core tab can be copied to any project (Controlla, Three, etc.)
  - Domain tab demonstrates project-specific patterns (trading UI)
  - Makes it easier to maintain consistency while allowing specialization

## WB-2025-01-18-001: Position Indicator Graphic Enhancement
**State**: paused
**Timeframe**: NOW
**Created**: 2025-01-18 12:00
**Dependencies**: None
**Tags**: #ui #visualization #positions #data-viz

### Goal
Enhance the position indicator graphic to provide accurate visual representation of position status with proper proportions relative to real pricing data.

### Requirements
1. **Fixed Width Implementation** âœ…
   - Converted to fixed pixel widths (120px container)
   - Consistent display across different screen sizes
   - Maintains proportions accurately

2. **Correct Ratio Spacing** âœ…
   - Elements proportionally spaced based on actual price points
   - Entry, current, stop, and target positions reflect relative distances
   - Visual spacing matches real-world pricing ratios

3. **Visual Key/Legend**
   - Add a key explaining color coding and symbols
   - Include labels for: Entry Price, Current Price, Stop Loss, Take Profit
   - Consider hover tooltips for additional context
   - Position the key in an unobtrusive but accessible location

4. **Technical Considerations** âœ… (partial)
   - Pixel positions calculated based on price ranges
   - Edge cases handled
   - Performance maintained with multiple indicators

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current PositionStatusBar implementation
- [x] Design new calculation system for proportional spacing
- [x] Implement fixed-width container with proper ratios
- [x] Convert to three-row layout (current price, segments, symbols/prices)
- [x] Switch from absolute positioning to flexbox
- [x] Standardize symbol widths to 9px
- [x] Apply theme variables throughout
- [ ] Handle stop loss changes elegantly
- [ ] Refine bottom row width solution
- [ ] Add pending and closed position indicators
- [ ] Create visual key component
- [ ] Add hover states and tooltips
- [ ] Test with various price scenarios
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Document the visualization logic

### Notes
- Successfully refactored from 350+ lines to 337 lines
- Three-row layout: current price (top), segments (middle), symbols/prices (bottom)
- Flexbox layout provides better maintainability than absolute positioning
- Dynamic current price positioning based on actual values working correctly
- Bottom row alignment solved with equal-width containers
- Remaining work focuses on edge cases and visual polish
