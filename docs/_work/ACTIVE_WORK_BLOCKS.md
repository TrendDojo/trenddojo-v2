## WB-2025-09-02-001: Critical Pattern Documentation Development
**State**: confirmed
**Timeframe**: NOW
**Created**: 2025-09-02 13:45
**Dependencies**: None
**Tags**: #foundation #documentation #production-ready

### Goal
Create essential pattern documentation to support production-ready development with proper financial validation and testing standards.

### Tasks
- [ ] **TRADING-PATTERNS.md**: Position sizing algorithms, risk/reward calculations, stop loss management, correlation rules
- [ ] **BROKER-INTEGRATION-PATTERNS.md**: API abstraction layer, mock development patterns, error handling, rate limiting
- [ ] **FINANCIAL-CALCULATIONS.md**: P&L formulas, position sizing math, risk calculations, validation requirements
- [ ] **RISK-MANAGEMENT-PATTERNS.md**: Position limits, stop loss logic, drawdown protection, account safeguards  
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE-PATTERNS.md**: Next.js structure, tRPC setup, database patterns, state management
- [ ] **SECURITY-PATTERNS.md**: API key management, financial data protection, audit trails
- [ ] **DEPLOYMENT-PATTERNS.md**: GitHub workflow, Vercel staging/prod, environment management
- [ ] **TESTING-PATTERNS.md**: Financial calculation testing, broker integration mocks, E2E workflows

### Success Criteria
- Each pattern doc contains real implementation examples
- Financial calculation patterns include unit test examples
- Broker integration patterns show complete mock setup
- All patterns reference production deployment requirements
- Documentation supports immediate development start

### Notes
- These docs are the foundation for production-ready development
- Each doc should be created when the pattern is first needed
- Focus on practical examples over theoretical explanations
- Must include testing requirements for each pattern

## WB-2025-09-02-003: Initial Project Structure & Dependencies
**State**: confirmed
**Timeframe**: LATER  
**Created**: 2025-09-02 13:45
**Dependencies**: WB-2025-09-08-001
**Tags**: #setup #nextjs #typescript #database

### Goal
Create Next.js 14+ project structure with all production dependencies and initial configuration.

### Tasks
- [ ] Initialize Next.js 14+ project with App Router
- [ ] Configure TypeScript with strict settings
- [ ] Set up Prisma with PostgreSQL schema
- [ ] Install and configure tRPC
- [ ] Set up NextAuth.js authentication
- [ ] Install Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- [ ] Configure Zustand state management
- [ ] Set up Vitest + Playwright testing
- [ ] Create initial database schema from setup document
- [ ] Configure environment variables template

### Success Criteria
- Clean Next.js project builds without errors
- Database connection established
- Basic authentication flow working
- Testing framework operational
- All TypeScript types properly configured

### Notes
- Reference the technical setup document for exact schema
- Follow the subscription tier structure from setup doc
- Ensure all dependencies match production requirements
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration for trading calculations

## WB-2025-09-08-001: Database Migration Pipeline Integration
**State**: confirmed
**Timeframe**: NEXT
**Created**: 2025-09-08 13:30
**Dependencies**: WB-2025-09-02-002 (completed)
**Tags**: #infrastructure #database #prisma #supabase #deployment

### Goal
Integrate database migration handling into the existing CI/CD pipeline to support database-dependent features safely.

### Tasks
- [ ] **Supabase Project Setup**: Create staging and production database projects
- [ ] **Database Environment Variables**: Configure DATABASE_URL for staging/production
- [ ] **Migration Safety Checks**: Add Prisma schema validation to CI pipeline
- [ ] **Deployment Migration Step**: Add `prisma migrate deploy` to GitHub Actions
- [ ] **Staging Database Integration**: Ensure staging deploys run migrations automatically
- [ ] **Production Migration Strategy**: Manual migration approval before production deployment
- [ ] **Database Connection Testing**: Verify database connectivity in CI pipeline
- [ ] **Rollback Strategy**: Document database rollback procedures

### Success Criteria
- Staging deployments automatically run database migrations
- Production deployments require explicit migration approval
- CI pipeline validates Prisma schema changes before deployment
- Database connection is verified before app deployment
- Migration failures block deployment
- Clear rollback documentation for database issues

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Supabase staging/production setup with environment variables
2. **Phase 2**: Add migration validation to existing CI pipeline
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate automatic migrations for staging
4. **Phase 4**: Manual migration approval workflow for production
5. **Phase 5**: Database connection testing and error handling

### Notes
- Builds on the existing successful CI/CD pipeline (WB-2025-09-02-002)
- Must not break current deployment functionality
- Focus on safety - better to block deployment than corrupt data
- Consider migration performance impact on deployment time
- Document migration best practices for development workflow
