# Documentation Refactor Log

*Started: 2025-09-28*

## Purpose
This log tracks the documentation consolidation effort to reduce 15,000+ lines across 60 files down to ~7,000 lines across 30 files, while preserving all relevant information.

## Process
1. Identify duplicate/overlapping documents
2. Find all cross-references to those documents
3. Create consolidated version with all relevant information
4. Move originals to this archive folder
5. Update all references to point to new location
6. Log the changes here
