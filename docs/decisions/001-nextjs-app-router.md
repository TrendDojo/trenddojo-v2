# ADR-001: Use Next.js 14 App Router

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development team

## Context

We needed to choose a frontend framework for TrendDojo that would provide:
- Excellent performance for a trading platform
- Type safety throughout the stack
- Good developer experience
- SEO capabilities for marketing pages
- Ability to handle both static and dynamic content

## Decision

We will use Next.js 14 with the App Router for the TrendDojo frontend.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Server Components**: Reduced client bundle size and better performance
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, font loading, script optimization
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with excellent DX
- **Flexibility**: Can do SSR, SSG, ISR, and client-side rendering as needed
- **Vercel Integration**: Seamless deployment with zero configuration
- **React Ecosystem**: Access to vast ecosystem of React libraries

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: App Router is newer, less documentation available
- **Complexity**: Server vs client components can be confusing initially
- **Breaking Changes**: Next.js moves fast, occasional breaking changes
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Some features work best on Vercel

### Neutral
- **File-based Routing**: Different from traditional React apps but intuitive
- **React Server Components**: New paradigm requires mental model shift
- **Caching Behavior**: Aggressive caching needs careful consideration

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Next.js Pages Router**: More mature but missing latest optimizations
2. **Remix**: Good alternative but smaller ecosystem
3. **Vite + React**: More control but requires more setup
4. **Angular**: Too heavy for our needs
5. **Vue/Nuxt**: Smaller talent pool

## Implementation Notes

- Use server components by default, client components only when needed
- Leverage parallel and intercepting routes for better UX
- Use route groups for organization without affecting URLs
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
