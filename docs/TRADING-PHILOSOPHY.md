# TrendDojo Trading Philosophy

## What We Support

### ✅ Swing Trading (Primary Focus)
- **Holding Period**: 3-10 days typical
- **Timeframes**: Daily charts for signals, 4-hour for entry refinement
- **Risk Per Trade**: 2-5% of portfolio
- **Position Management**: Trail stops at swing highs/lows
- **Example**: Buy on daily chart breakout, hold through multi-day move

### ✅ Trend Following
- **Holding Period**: Weeks to months
- **Timeframes**: Weekly for trend, daily for entries
- **Risk Per Trade**: 1-3% of portfolio
- **Position Management**: Wide stops, pyramid into winners
- **Example**: Ride a multi-month uptrend with trailing stop

### ✅ Position Trading
- **Holding Period**: Months
- **Timeframes**: Weekly and monthly charts
- **Risk Per Trade**: 1-2% of portfolio
- **Position Management**: Strategic accumulation/distribution
- **Example**: Build core position over several entries

### ⚠️ Buy & Hold (With Caveats)
- **Supported but not primary focus**
- **Must have exit rules** (not truly "hold forever")
- **Risk management still applies**
- **Example**: Core ETF position with 20% trailing stop

## What We DON'T Support

### ❌ Day Trading
**We explicitly DO NOT support day trading:**
- No intraday positions (closing before market close)
- No scalping strategies
- No 1-minute or 5-minute charts
- No high-frequency trading
- Minimum holding period is overnight

### ❌ Why No Day Trading?
1. **Different Infrastructure**: Requires real-time data, low latency execution
2. **Different Risk Profile**: Pattern Day Trader rules, higher stress
3. **Different User Needs**: Constant monitoring vs. systematic execution
4. **Our Mission**: "Systematic execution without daily management"

### ❌ Other Unsupported Strategies
- Options strategies (may add later)
- Forex carry trades
- Crypto yield farming
- Arbitrage strategies

## Timeframe Hierarchy

### Primary Decision Timeframes
- **Weekly**: Major trend identification
- **Daily**: Entry/exit signals, position management

### Secondary Timeframes
- **4-Hour**: Entry refinement ONLY (not signal generation)
  - Used to optimize entry price
  - Find better stop placement
  - Confirm daily signal momentum

### Never Used
- **1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute**: Too short for our strategies
- **Tick charts**: Day trading tool
- **Volume bars**: Day trading tool

## Risk Management Philosophy

### Position Sizing
- Risk-based (% of portfolio)
- Never risk more than 5% per trade
- Scale down in volatile markets
- Total portfolio risk limits

### Stop Losses
- Always use stops (no "hope and pray")
- Based on chart structure, not arbitrary percentages
- Wide enough for normal volatility
- Tight enough to preserve capital

### Portfolio Management
- Maximum 5-8 positions for swing trading
- Maximum 3-5 for trend following
- Correlation limits between positions
- Progressive position building

## Platform Design Implications

### What This Means for Features
- **Entry signals refresh daily**, not intraday
- **Stops based on daily closes**, not intraday prices
- **No need for streaming quotes**
- **Alerts can have hours of delay tolerance**
- **Focus on end-of-day analysis**

### What This Means for Users
- Check platform once or twice per day
- Set alerts and walk away
- Weekend analysis and planning
- No screen watching required
- True systematic execution

**Remember: TrendDojo is for traders who want systematic execution without constant monitoring. We are NOT a day trading platform.**
