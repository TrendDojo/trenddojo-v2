# Release Process Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What We've Implemented

### 1. Standardized Release Documentation
**Location**: Across TrendDojo and Shared Framework

#### Files Created/Updated:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Standard release tracking
- `docs/releases/` - Detailed release notes
- `_shared-framework/standards/RELEASE-DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD.md` - The standard

### 2. Integrated with Deployment Process
**Key Change**: Added Phase 3 to deployment workflow

```
Phase 1: Local Dev
Phase 2: Preview Testing
Phase 3: Release Documentation ‚Üê NEW (version AFTER preview)
Phase 4: Production Deployment
```

### 3. The Critical Rule
**Version numbers are assigned AFTER preview verification, not before**

## üìã Quick Reference

### To Make a Release:
1. Push code to preview: `git push origin dev`
2. Test on preview environment
3. **After tests pass**, update CHANGELOG.md
4. Bump version: `npm version minor`
5. Tag release: `git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Release v0.3.0"`
6. Deploy to production: `git push origin main --tags`

### Files to Update:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Move items from Unreleased
- `package.json` - Version number
- `docs/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` - Major releases only

## üîó Cross-Project Consistency

### Standard Location:
`_shared-framework/standards/RELEASE-DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD.md`

### Applies To:
- [x] TrendDojo (implemented)
- [ ] Controlla V2 (next)
- [ ] TraderClicks (next)
- [ ] Three (next)

## üìä Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear History**: CHANGELOG.md shows what changed when
2. **Safe Releases**: Versions only after testing
3. **Professional**: Following industry standards
4. **Discoverable**: Standard locations for all docs

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Apply same pattern to other projects
2. Consider automation (semantic-release)
3. Add to onboarding docs
