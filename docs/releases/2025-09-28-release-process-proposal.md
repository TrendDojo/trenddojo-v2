# Proposal: Standardized Release Process Integration

**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Type**: Process Improvement
**Scope**: TrendDojo + Shared Framework

## Executive Summary
Implement standardized release documentation across all projects with clear versioning after preview verification.

## The Problem
- No consistent release tracking across projects
- Version numbers assigned before testing
- No standard changelog format
- Missing link between deployments and releases

## The Solution

### 1. Standard Release Flow
```
Code → Preview Test → Version → Release → Production
        ↑                ↑
        |                |
     MUST PASS      THEN VERSION
```

### 2. Implementation Complete

#### Created Standards
✅ **Shared Framework**
- `/standards/RELEASE-DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD.md` - Concise, actionable standard

✅ **TrendDojo Implementation**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history following Keep a Changelog
- `docs/releases/` - Detailed release notes directory
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Added Phase 3: Release Documentation
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT_AUDIT_CLAUSE.md` - Added release requirements

### 3. Key Process Change
**Version numbers are assigned AFTER preview/staging verification, not before**

This ensures:
- Versions represent tested code
- No "un-releasing" if tests fail
- Clear distinction between "deployed" and "released"

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: TrendDojo (COMPLETE)
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created
- [x] Release directory structure
- [x] Deployment guide updated
- [x] Audit requirements added

### Phase 2: Shared Framework (COMPLETE)
- [x] Release standard created
- [x] Kept concise (1 page)
- [x] Focus on actionable steps

### Phase 3: Other Projects (NEXT)
Apply same pattern to:
- [ ] Controlla V2
- [ ] TraderClicks
- [ ] Three

## Benefits
1. **Predictable** - Same process everywhere
2. **Traceable** - Git tags match versions
3. **Professional** - Industry-standard changelog
4. **Safe** - Version after verification

## Success Metrics
- All projects have CHANGELOG.md within 30 days
- 100% of releases tagged in git
- Zero "rollback" versions due to failed tests

## Approval
This proposal implements industry best practices with minimal overhead.

**Recommended**: Approve and apply to all projects.
